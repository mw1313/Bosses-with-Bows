Find relevant, high-quality sources and organize findings in structured format for content production workflows.

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the Brief
- Read research brief for core questions
- Note constraints (time period, geography, source types)
- Clarify scope: exploratory or validation

### 2. Search Strategy
- Use web_search for recent information, trends, statistics
- Look for primary sources (research papers, official data)
- Prioritize European sources when relevant
- Avoid low-quality sources (forums, AI content farms)

### 3. Information Gathering
- Use web_fetch to read full articles
- Extract facts, statistics, quotes, examples
- Note publication dates
- Document counterarguments
- Identify knowledge gaps

### 4. Source Validation
- Check author credentials and publication reputation
- Verify claims across multiple sources
- Flag questionable information
- Note confidence level (high/medium/low)

### 5. Structure Output
- Organize findings by theme or question
- Use clear headers and sections
- Cite sources inline with URLs
- Highlight key findings
- Note what couldn't be found
